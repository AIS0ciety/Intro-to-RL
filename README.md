# Intro-to-RL
Material for Reinforcement Learning Workshop

**Video resource**: [David Silver's Course on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ). This is one the best material to start learning reinforcement learning.

**Book**: [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf). This book is also one of the best to build your fundamentals in RL.

**Notes**: This folder has notes used by david silver during his course. We will also be following this.

**Mine Notes**: I made them while I was studying the concepts of RL. you can refer them for pseudo codes and maths. If you dont understand them just make an issue and I will answer the questions.

**Blogs**: This list of blogs will be updates regularly .. ;)
